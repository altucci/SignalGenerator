# SignalGenerator

Embedded software application written in Embedded C.

This application serves as a digital signal generator.
An oscilliscope would be needed to measure the signal on the applicable output pins.

-------

(You must first have downloaded Tern's Paradigm IDE desktop software)

Compile and link the .c file via the Paradigm IDE, and this will create a new .HEX file.

Burn the .HEX file into the Flash EEPROM chip of the microcontroller via the Paradigm IDE.

Or bypass compilation and simply burn the existing .HEX file.

(Step-by-step instructions on how to do this are included in the Technical Documents folder)
